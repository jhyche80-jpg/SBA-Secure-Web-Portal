Tip: To type arrows on Windows, use Alt codes  
Left arrow: Alt + 27  
Right arrow: Alt + 26  
Up arrow: Alt + 24  
Down arrow: Alt + 25  

### Questions and Answers

Example:  
Q: How should input be collected  
A: Use a controlled form field  

Q: How do I validate the data  
A: Check input format and length  

### Input
Describe what data the project takes in.  
Explain where the input comes from and how the user provides it.

Example:  
- Username from input field  
- Password from input field  

### Output

## Step by Step Plan
Plan before building.

1. Set up project folder  
2. Build UI form  
3. Add validation logic  
4. Connect API  
5. Test error cases  
6. Add redirect logic  
7. Final testing

## Build Steps
Explain what you did and why you did it.  
Include key decisions and any improvements you made during the build.

Example:  
- I built the form first to define the structure  
- I added validation after the UI was working  
- I refactored the API call to simplify the logic
